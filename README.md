# ACSAPI
Interface to American Community Survey to pull state data.

This project uses the PopulationGraph.R file to pull age related data from the US Census Bureau's
American Community Survey using the UIS Census API. 

To get this R script to work, you will need to request an API key from the Census Bureau and paste it into a .txt file
in the project directory, titled "APIkey.txt".
